# Workspace Management

The `workspace` package in the Orchestra backend is responsible for creating, isolating, and managing the ephemeral filesystem environments where agents perform their work.

## 🗂️ The Isolation Model

When an agent begins a task, it never works directly on the host machine's primary repository. Instead, Orchestra provisions a dedicated, sandboxed workspace.

### The Provisioning Lifecycle (`service.go`)

1. **Path Resolution**: The `WorkspacePath` function generates a unique directory path based on the `WorkspaceRoot` configuration and the specific `issueIdentifier` (e.g., `~/.orchestra/workspaces/FETCH-1`).
2. **State Validation**: `EnsureIssueWorkspace` checks if the path exists. If it exists but isn't a directory, or if it's stale, it aggressively cleans it up.
3. **Directory Creation**: A fresh directory is created with `0o755` permissions.
4. **Safety Markers**: The system places a hidden `.orchestra` marker file in the workspace root. **Path Guard** mechanisms enforce that destructive operations (like deleting a workspace) will immediately fail if this marker is missing, preventing accidental deletion of user data outside the sandbox.

## 🪝 Lifecycle Hooks (`hooks.go`)

To bridge the gap between a blank directory and a fully functional development environment, Orchestra implements a robust hook system.

Hooks are arbitrary shell scripts defined in your `WORKFLOW.md`. They run at precise moments during the session lifecycle:

*   **`after_create`**: Fired immediately after the workspace directory is created. **Use Case**: Cloning the git repository, checking out the specific branch, and running `npm install` or `go mod download`.
*   **`before_run`**: Fired right before the agent CLI is invoked. **Use Case**: Setting up local environment variables or starting background database containers.
*   **`after_run`**: Fired immediately after the agent CLI exits. **Use Case**: Capturing test coverage reports or tearing down temporary containers.
*   **`before_remove`**: Fired before the orchestrator deletes the workspace directory.

### Hook Result Diagnostics
Unlike basic command execution, Orchestra captures the raw `stdout` and `stderr` of every hook in a `HookResult` object. 
- **Persistence**: These logs are stored in the telemetry stream.
- **UI Visibility**: If a hook fails, its status badge in the **Issue Detail** view becomes interactive. Operators can click the badge to view the full execution transcript, making environment debugging near-instant.

## 📦 Artifact Management

The `workspace` service also provides APIs for the Desktop UI to inspect the results of an agent's work. 
- **Recursive Discovery**: The `ListArtifacts` function recursively walks the workspace directory.
- **Autonomous Reports**: Orchestra automatically promotes files named `ORCHESTRA_REPORT.md` or `SUMMARY.md` to the primary **Report** tab in the UI, providing a verified executive summary of the agent's work.

## 🔒 Security & Path Guard

The system uses `ValidateWorkspacePath` and `ValidateProjectPath` to ensure all filesystem operations are strictly jail-bound within the configured roots. 
- **Marker Enforcement**: A hidden `.orchestra` marker file is required for workspace deletion.
- **Path Escape Prevention**: All relative paths are sanitized to prevent `../` attacks.
